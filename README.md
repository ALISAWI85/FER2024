# FER2024
As a result of an accurate and comprehensive review of the original and wild datasets, FER13, a new dataset consisting of 10 categories (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise, contempt, confused, and sleepy), has a total of 72,000 images after augmenting the relevant classes. Moreover, two models were presented for emotion recognition from facial images, both of which achieved remarkable results that outperformed the state-of-the-art studies.
